In that course, we learned all about DevOps practices, which are super important for making workplaces more efficient. 
We dove into using procedures, protocols, and the best ways of doing things in the industry. The cool part? 
We got to try everything out ourselves with hands-on activities and standard toolkits. We learned how to 
analyze and use different methods for developer operations. And not only that, but we also tackled tricky 
business problems by getting really good at handling different types of data like JSON, and YAML. 
Plus, we became proficient at using DevOps tools like Ansible and Git. It was an exciting journey!
